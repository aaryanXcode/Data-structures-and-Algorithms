## RECURSION OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES






1. Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
   * Avoid re-computing the same recursive call.
   * Store the result in a variable and reuse it.
   * Example:
     // Instead of:
     return f(n/2) \* f(n/2);
     // Do:
     int half = f(n/2);
     return half \* half;
2. Memoization
   * Store results of subproblems in a hash map or array.
   * Helps in avoiding repeated work in overlapping subproblems.
   * Example:
     unordered_map<int, int> dp;
     int f(int n) {
     if (dp.count(n)) return dp\[n\];
     return dp\[n\] = f(n-1) + f(n-2);
     }
3. Bottom-up DP (Tabulation)
   * Convert recursive logic to iterative.
   * Solve subproblems in order and build up to final result.
   * Uses array or compressed variables to store intermediate states.
4. Tail Recursion
   * Move computation into parameters to allow compiler to optimize stack usage.
   * Only effective if compiler supports tail call optimization.


## HOW TO APPROACH A BOTTOM-UP SOLUTION

Step 1: Start with the recursive solution
\- Identify base cases and recursive relation.

Step 2: Identify subproblems and overlapping calls
\- What smaller problems are used to build larger ones?

Step 3: Figure out the order to solve subproblems
\- Ensure you solve smaller subproblems before bigger ones.

Step 4: Create table or variables to store solutions
\- Either use a DP array or space-optimized variables.

Step 5: Generalize the pattern
\- Define base cases, transition formula, and solve in correct order.

Example ‚Äì Fibonacci (Bottom-up DP):
int fib(int n) {
if (n <= 1) return n;
int a = 0, b = 1;
for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
int c = a + b;
a = b;
b = c;
}
return b;
}

### üîπ Step 5: **Generalize the pattern**

Once you've done this for one problem, generalize for others:

| Component | What to Identify |
|----|----|
| **Base Case(s)** | Smallest inputs (usually recursion's base) |
| **Transition** | How current value is built from previous ones |
| **State** | What variables/array store the subproblem states |
| **Order** | Ensure you compute in correct dependency order |



### üß† Summary: Bottom-Up Approach Template






1. Start with the recursive relation
2. Identify subproblems and dependencies
3. Determine the computation order
4. Replace recursion with loop
5. Use arrays or variables to store results
6. Return final result


# Important note:

i was  sorting stack using recursion and observed the most the the stack and recursion related problems comes with the inserting a element at some position , in sorting we are doing the same in reverse we have to do the similar thing insert the element at bottom of the stack, so the crux is inserting a problem, calling stack and breaking it recursively is easy but inserting has the core logic

# Key points to remeber

| Task | Typical code |
|----|----|
| Subset/Subsequence | Include/Exclude recursion (a special form of backtracking) |
| Permutation | Backtracking with **swap + undo** |
| Combination (like choosing `k` out of `n`) | Backtracking with **for loops + visited states** |





| Type | How to count |
|----|----|
| Subset / Subsequence | `2^n` |
| Permutation (all `n` elements) | `n!` |
| Permutation (pick `k`) | `nPk = n!/(n-k)!` |
| Combination (pick `k`) | `nCk = n!/(k!(n-k)!)` |
| k-ary strings (length `n`) | `k^n` |


## üîÅ When to use a `for` loop:

You are **not limited to one binary choice** (like pick/not-pick), but instead:

* You can choose from **multiple remaining elements**
* You are exploring **combinations, permutations**, or **subsets with duplicates**
* You want to try all candidates that haven‚Äôt been tried yet (from index `start` onward)

### üí° Think: ‚ÄúTry every path‚Äù = Loop


---

## ‚ùå When to skip the loop:

Use only **pick / not-pick** if:

* At each step, you're **only deciding about the current index**
* It‚Äôs a **binary choice**: take it or skip it
* The recursion grows like a **binary tree** with two branches per call


---

## üß† Ultimate takeaway:

| Situation | Strategy |
|----|----|
| Multiple choices to explore at each step | üîÅ Use loop (`for i = start...`) |
| Only one choice at each step: pick or not | üîÄ Use pick/not-pick (no loop) |
